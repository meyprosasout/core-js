Oracle Jinitiator is a legacy plug-in that was developed by Oracle to support older versions of Oracle Forms applications. However, it is no longer supported by Oracle and may not work properly on newer browsers and operating systems. Therefore, it is recommended that you upgrade your Oracle Forms applications to the latest version that uses Java Web Start technology instead of Oracle Jinitiator. Java Web Start is a more secure and reliable way to launch Java applications over the web without requiring a browser plug-in. It also supports a wider range of platforms and browsers than Oracle Jinitiator.
 
To upgrade your Oracle Forms applications to use Java Web Start, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install the latest version of Oracle Forms from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud.
2. Configure your Oracle Forms server to use Java Web Start by following the instructions in the Oracle documentation.
3. Modify your HTML files that launch your Oracle Forms applications to use the Java Web Start URL syntax instead of the Oracle Jinitiator URL syntax. You can use the Oracle Forms Migration Assistant tool to automate this process.
4. Test your upgraded Oracle Forms applications on your web browser using Java Web Start.

By upgrading your Oracle Forms applications to use Java Web Start, you can enjoy better performance, security and compatibility with modern web technologies. You can also avoid potential issues and errors that may arise from using Oracle Jinitiator on unsupported platforms and browsers.
